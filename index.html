            <h3>Graduated US Army Ranger School</h3>
            <p><strong>Ranger</strong> School is one of the toughest training courses for which a Soldier can volunteer.
                Army Rangers are experts in leading Soldiers on difficult missions - and to do this, they need rigorous
                training. For more than two months, Ranger students train to exhaustion, pushing the limits of their
                minds and bodies.

                The purpose of the Army's Ranger course is to prepare these Army volunteers - both officers and enlisted
                Soldiers - in combat arms related functional skills. The Rangers' primary mission is to engage in close
                combat and direct-fire battles.

                The Ranger Course was conceived during the Korean War and was known as the Ranger Training Command. The
                Ranger Training Command was inactivated and became the Ranger Department, a branch of the Infantry
                School at Fort Benning, Ga., Oct. 10, 1951. Its purpose was, and still is, to develop combat skills of
                selected officers and enlisted men. This requires them to perform effectively as small-unit leaders in a
                realistic, tactical environment, and under mental and physical stress; approaches that are found in
                actual combat. Emphasis is placed on the development of individual combat skills and abilities through
                the application of the principles of leadership, while further developing military skills in the
                planning and conduct of dismounted infantry, airborne, airmobile, amphibious independent squad, and
                platoon-size operations. Graduates return to their units to pass on these skills.

                From 1954 to the early 1970's, the Army's goal, though seldom achieved, was to have one Ranger qualified
                non-commissioned officer per infantry platoon and one officer per company. In an effort to better
                achieve this goal, in 1954, the Army required all combat arms officers to become Ranger/Airborne
                qualified.

                The Ranger course has changed little since its inception. Until recently, it was an eight-week course
                divided into three phases: "crawl," "walk," and "run." The course is now 61 days in duration and remains
                divided into three phases: "benning," "mountain," and "florida."</p>
