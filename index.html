                    <h3>Graduated US Army Ranger School</h3>
                    <p><strong>Ranger</strong> School is one of the toughest training courses for which a Soldier can
                        volunteer.
                        Army Rangers are experts in leading Soldiers on difficult missions - and to do this, they need
                        rigorous
                        training. For more than two months, Ranger students train to exhaustion, pushing the limits of
                        their
                        minds and bodies.

                        The purpose of the Army's Ranger course is to prepare these Army volunteers - both officers and
                        enlisted
                        Soldiers - in combat arms related functional skills. The Rangers' primary mission is to engage
                        in
                        close
                        combat and direct-fire battles.

                        The Ranger Course was conceived during the Korean War and was known as the Ranger Training
                        Command.
                        The
                        Ranger Training Command was inactivated and became the Ranger Department, a branch of the
                        Infantry
                        School at Fort Benning, Ga., Oct. 10, 1951. Its purpose was, and still is, to develop combat
                        skills
                        of
                        selected officers and enlisted men. This requires them to perform effectively as small-unit
                        leaders
                        in a
                        realistic, tactical environment, and under mental and physical stress; approaches that are found
                        in
                        actual combat. Emphasis is placed on the development of individual combat skills and abilities
                        through
                        the application of the principles of leadership, while further developing military skills in the
                        planning and conduct of dismounted infantry, airborne, airmobile, amphibious independent squad,
                        and
                        platoon-size operations. Graduates return to their units to pass on these skills.

                        From 1954 to the early 1970's, the Army's goal, though seldom achieved, was to have one Ranger
                        qualified
                        non-commissioned officer per infantry platoon and one officer per company. In an effort to
                        better
                        achieve this goal, in 1954, the Army required all combat arms officers to become Ranger/Airborne
                        qualified.

                        The Ranger course has changed little since its inception. Until recently, it was an eight-week
                        course
                        divided into three phases: "crawl," "walk," and "run." The course is now 61 days in duration and
                        remains
                        divided into three phases: "benning," "mountain," and "florida."</p>
