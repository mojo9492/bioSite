                    <strong>Books</strong> are a gateway to a different world or a window to new knowledge. Here are
                    some of Patrick's favorites.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The <i>Dune</i> saga is acclaimed
                            as the best selling sci-fi novel of all time. Frank Herbert was a science fiction author who
                            wrote <i>Dune</i> and five of its sequels. The saga take place over a millennia, and covers
                            humankind's survival in empires of far away planetary systems. It has spawned a franchise,
                            producing prequel novels, movies and tv shows spanning over the 80's and including the
                            release of 2021's theatrical <i>Dune</i>.

                <article>
                    <strong>A</strong> game of nordic horror roleplaying that is based off a talented Swedish
                    illustrator
                    and author Johan Egerkrans. The theme is centered around Nordic folklore and myths from Scandinavia.
                    The
                    game pits players, who have the magical ability to see creatures called Vaesen, which are invisible
                    to
                    everyone else. The player's character is from a collective call the Society, whose members are
                    deployed
                    in to handle these creatures when they cause chaos. A character has four attributes and twelve
                    skills
                    that make up the character's stats. When player's perform actions, they roll a dice to determine the
                    outcome. The gameplay loop is like so: discover the Vaesen through clues, determine how to defeat
                    the
                    Vaesen and then perform the ritual to drive the creature away.

                    <strong>"I</strong> don't like either the word or the thing. People ought to saunter in the
                    mountains â€” not hike! Do you know the origin of that word 'saunter?' It's a beautiful word. Away
                    back in the Middle Ages people used to go on pilgrimages to the Holy Land, and when people in the
                    villages through which they passed asked where they were going, they would reply, 'A la sainte
                    terre,' 'To the Holy Land.' And so they became known as sainte-terre-ers or saunterers. Now these
                    mountains are our Holy Land, and we ought to saunter through them reverently, not 'hike' through
                    them." - John Muir
