                <strong>A</strong> game of nordic horror roleplaying that is based off a talented Swedish illustrator
                and author Johan Egerkrans. The theme is centered around Nordic folklore and myths from Scandinavia. The
                game pits players, who have the magical ability to see creatures called Vaesen, which are invisible to
                everyone else. The player's character is from a collective call the Society, whose members are deployed
                in to handle these creatures when they cause chaos. A character has four attributes and twelve skills
                that make up the character's stats. When player's perform actions, they roll a dice to determine the
                outcome. The gameplay loop is like so: discover the Vaesen through clues, determine how to defeat the
                Vaesen and then perform the ritual to drive the creature away.
